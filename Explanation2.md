### Regular samples or bootstrap samples?
As we can see in this example, if we can get as many regular samples as bootstrap samples, the regular ones get consistently closer to the population parameter.

Nevertheless, **the larger the amount of samples, the more the sampling distributions of statistics overlap**. We can get a feeling then, of how useful can bootstrap resampling be, in the absence of more real data.

As we can see, in these scenarios bootstrapping can gives us an intuitive idea about the uncertainty of our estimates.
